{Carl Sagan, 1934 - 1996}%

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a fabulously accurate description of the most fundamental forces and particles known to exist.
It has been shown to be robust beyond measure in the first years of running at the LHC.
In this chapter I discuss the theory of the SM, its successes and failings, and motivate a Supersymmtric extension of the SM.
