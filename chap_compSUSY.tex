{(1928) Max Born, 1882 -- 1970}


This chapter and the next describe a search for events containing a single energetic jet and missing transverse momentum, 
using a data sample collected at 8~\TeV by the \ac{CMS} detector at the \ac{CERN} \ac{LHC} and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7~\fbinv.
In this chapter, we describe the event selection of the search as well as background estimations and their associated systematic uncertainties.



\section{Introduction}


The monojet signature of a high \pt jet and an imbalance of momentum in the transverse plane is the discovery signal for many new physics scenarios that have genuine missing energy in the final state. 
Searches for Large Extra Dimensions in the framework of the \ac{ADD} model~\cite{ADDextraDimensions}, 
for \ac{DM} using effective field theory and simplified models, 
and Unparticle production~\cite{bib:Delgado} have been presented in previous searches both at the LHC and the Tevatron~\cite{Abazov:2008kp,Aaltonen:2008hh,Aaltonen:2012jb,Aad:2011xw,ATLAS:2012ky,bib:CMS_EXO11003,bib:CMSEXO11059,bib:CMSEXO12048}
using the monojet channel.
Signals are commonly invisible; for example the theorized \ac{DM} is a \ac{WIMP} candidate, and as such, does not interact with any part of the detector.
It therefore leaves no signal but an imbalance of momentum in the transverse plane, which is balanced by an \ac{ISR} particle. 
In this case, the \ac{ISR} particle is a quark or gluon, leading to a high \pt jet. 
Searches have also been conducted using other radiated particles: photons (termed ``monophoton'') and \W or \Z bosons (``mono-W'' or ``mono-Z'')~\cite{monophoton1,monophoton2,monophoton3,monophoton4, Aaltonen:2008hh,monophoton5,monophoton6,monophoton7}.
However, because monojet searches have the advantage of higher production cross sections (as the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}$ is greater than the electromagnetic or weak coupling constants), they typically lead to stronger limits.

A search for compressed \ac{SUSY} in the third generation is motivated in Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}.
Such signals are slightly different: Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:feynmandiagrams}. 
The final state does not just consist of missing transverse momentum balanced by an ISR jet; 
there are also sparticle decay products.
These are therefore not pure monojet signals.
However, when the mass difference between the parent sparticle and the \ac{LSP} decreases below 80~\GeV, decay products become increasingly soft
and indistinguishable from \ac{SM} backgrounds.
Events that have an energetic \ac{ISR} jet produced in association with parent sparticles, which recoils against the missing transverse momentum due to the LSP leaving the detector (``boosted events''),
provide a clear signature in such scenarios.
One high \pt jet alongside large \MET give rise to a monojet final state, in events where the soft sparticle decay products are too soft to observe.


Searches are for the pair production of 
third generation squarks followed by their decay to jets and the LSP, where the LSP is taken to be the lightest neutralino \chiOneZero, 
and the LSP is close in mass to the parent squark.
Top squarks \sTop are assumed to undergo the \ac{FCNC} loop-induced decay $\sTop \rightarrow \charmquark \chiOneZero$ with 100\% branching fraction, and
bottom squarks \sBot are assumed to decay via 
$\sBot \rightarrow \bottomquark \chiOneZero$ with 100\% branching fraction.
By selecting events using particles produced alongside \sTop\santiTop or \sBot\santiBot, and being independent of the soft final-state jets, the search is sensitive to mass differences of less than 10~\GeV.
The search presented here is an optimization of the well-established search detailed in Refs.~\cite{bib:CMSEXO12048,bib:CMS_EXO11003,bib:CMSEXO11059}, performed by the author as part of the CMS monojet group.

\section{Data samples}
\label{sec:data}

The data for this search were collected using a combination of two triggers at the \ac{HLT}. 
The first requires events to have $\MET>120$~\GeV.
The second, a dedicated monojet trigger, requires a central jet ($|\eta|<2.6$) with $\pt>80~\GeV$ and \MET 
(calculated without muons) to be greater than 95 or 105~\GeV. 
These triggers also have coarse noise cleaning filters applied. 
The first has various requirements on the energy deposits in the \ac{HCAL} to cut out noisy events, 
and the second demands that the neutral energy deposited in the \ac{ECAL} is less than 95\% of the total energy deposited.
They are seeded by \ac{L1} triggers which require the missing transverse momentum, calculated using \ac{L1} seeds and in \ac{L1} energy units, to be greater than 36, 40 or 50 for the first trigger, or greater than 40 for the second trigger. 


Very few events with \MET below 100 GeV, where it is calculated offline using optimal object reconstruction,  will pass the analysis triggers described above that require \MET calculated online to be above 120~\GeV, or to be above 95 or 105~\GeV without muons. 
However, most events with \MET (reconstructed offline) above 200~\GeV will pass the same analysis triggers. 
It is therefore necessary to calculate the efficiency of these triggers in terms of the key analysis variables, \MET and the \pt of the leading jet, in order to find where best to place offline analysis cuts. 
An independent sample of events collected using a trigger requiring a single isolated muon with $\pt > 24$ and $|\eta|<2.4$ is used.
The efficiency is given by the ratio of the number events passing the analysis triggers to the number of events passing the reference trigger. 
Efficiencies are shown in the trigger turn-on curves in Figure~\ref{fig:trigger-1D} as a function of \MET\ and the \pt\ of the leading jet, as reconstructed offline. 
Here, the different colours show the different runs (A--D) of the \ac{LHC} during Run I.
The dedicated monojet trigger described above was introduced for Run C, which increased the efficiency of the combination of the triggers for lower values of \MET and leading jet \pt as compared to Runs A and B. 
%A two-dimensional plot of the trigger efficiency is shown as a function of the \MET\ and leading jet \pt\ in Figure~\ref{fig:trigger-2D}. 
The plots in Figure~\ref{fig:trigger-1D} show that the trigger paths become almost 100\% efficient at $\pt(j_1)\sim110~\GeV$ and $\MET\sim220~\GeV$.

The specific datasets used for this analysis, along with their integrated luminosities, can be found in Table~\ref{tab:dataSets}. 
The data are from a `good-run' list of \ac{LHC} runs, in which each of the subsystems of the \ac{CMS} detector were operating well, and therefore event reconstruction was optimal.
Events were re-reconstructed using the \verb+CMSSW_5_3_9_patch3+ release of the \ac{CMS} software (CMSSW), and form a part of the legacy dataset from Run I of \ac{CMS} running.

\section{Background MC simulation} 
\label{sec:GEN}
\ac{MC} simulation of \ac{SM} backgrounds are used, directly and indirectly, to estimate the contribution of \ac{SM} backgrounds to the number of events in the search regions. 
The \ac{SM} processes considered are;  \W or \Z bosons produced in association with jets, top quark pair production (\ttbar), diboson (\W\W, \W\Z, \Z\Z, \W$\gamma$ and \Z$\gamma$) production, single top quark events, and QCD multijet processes.

The simulation of each sample follows a similar procedure.
Events are generated using a matrix element event generator such as \MADGRAPH{}~\cite{madgraph,madgraph2}, which simulates the underlying process at parton level. 
The event is then passed through a parton showering programme, usually \PYTHIA{}~\cite{pythia,pythia8,pythia-z2} in which partons undergo hadronization: quarks hadronize into jets.
It is finally passed through a simulation of the CMS detector in order to mimic the detector's response to the event.
All simulated \ac{SM} background events have gone through a \GEANTfour~\cite{Geant4-1,Geant4-2} simulation of the detector. 
This is a `full' simulation, computationally expensive and providing accurate responses to the simulated physics objects.  
For simulation of signal (detailed later), a `fast' simulation~\cite{FASTSIM} is used instead as it is around 100 times faster to process each event and has a comparable accuracy.

Samples of \Z bosons decaying invisibly (\znunubr{}\,+\,jets), \ttbar, and diboson events 
are simulated using \MADGRAPH{}5 interfaced with \PYTHIA{}6.4.24. 
To evaluate the content of the proton in the initial state, the CTEQ6L \ac{PDFs} are used~\cite{CTEQ6}. 
%Samples are simulated using the custom CMS event tune Z2$^{*}$, which is derived from the Z1 tune~\cite{pythia-z2} which uses the CTEQ5L \ac{PDFs}, whereas the Z2$^{*}$ uses the CTEQ6L set.
Simulated Drell--Yan (\zellellbr{}\,+\,jets) and \wpj{} events are generated in the same way, where a cut has been placed on the transverse momentum of the boson, $\pt > 100$ \GeV, in order to increase the number of generated events that pass offline selection requirements (and where the production cross section has been modified accordingly).
QCD multijet events are generated with \PYTHIA{}6.4.24, using the CTEQ~6L1~\ac{PDFs}. 
Single top quark processes (s-channel, t-channel and tW-channel production) are generated using \POWHEG~\cite{powheg_st,powheg_tw}.
Decays of the $\tau$ lepton are simulated using the \TAUOLA{} 27.121.5 package~\cite{TAUOLA}. 

To ensure no double counting in phase space between the underlying event and the fragmentation and hadronization process, the MLM shower matching prescription~\cite{bib:GEN_MLM} is used, in which partons from the matrix element calculation are matched to jets resulting from the hadron shower.
In order to avoid double counting photons from the \PYTHIA shower in \wpj{} and \W$\gamma$ samples (and similarly for \zellellbr{}\,+\,jets and \Z$\gamma$ samples), 
events from the \wpj{} and \zellellbr{}\,+\,jets simulation which have a photon from \ac{ISR} or \ac{FSR}, of $\pt(\gamma)>5$ \GeV, are removed.


\section{Object reconstruction}
\label{sec:objectReco}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:detector} the CMS detector and reconstruction methods are discussed at length, including those used in this analysis. 
Here, I briefly recap the important features of the object reconstruction and give more detail on the object definitions.

\subsection{Jets and \MET}

Jets and \MET are reconstructed using a \ac{PF}
technique~\cite{PFT-09-001}. The algorithm produces a unique list 
of particles in each event, using the combined information from all 
CMS subdetectors. This list is then used as input to the jet 
clustering, which reconstructs jets using the anti-k$_{\mathrm{t}}$
algorithm~\cite{bib:akjets} with a distance parameter of 0.5.  
The missing transverse energy vector \METvmu is computed as the negative vector 
sum of the transverse momenta of all particles reconstructed in the 
event, except muons.
Its magnitude is referred to as \METmu.


Jet energies are corrected to establish a uniform calorimeter 
response in $\eta$ and an absolute response in \pt, calibrated at 
the particle level.  
\ac{JES} corrections are derived from simulation, and a residual correction calculated by measuring the \pt balance in dijet and $\gamma$+jets events is applied to events in data~\cite{JETJINST} to account for differences in the \ac{JES} between data and simulation.
The jet energy corrections used are `L2L3Residual' and `L1FastJet'.
To resolve any ambiguity in the reconstruction of jets and leptons, a jet is removed from the event if the energy fraction of an electron or muon in the jet is greater than 0.5.



\subsection{Leptons}
\label{sec:objectReco:lep}

Leptons are also reconstructed using the \ac{PF} algorithm and the definitions of objects are in accordance with the \ac{CMS} recommendations.
In addition to muons, electrons and $\tau$ leptons are also used in the analysis.
Muons either pass a ``loose'' or ``tight'' selection criteria (which has more stringent requirements). 
Electrons must pass a ``loose'' selection criteria, and the \ac{HPS} algorithm with ``loose'' criteria is used to reconstruct hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons ($\tauh$).

A loose muon must have \pt greater than 10~\GeV, and be tagged as a Global or Tracker muon --- meaning that it must
have independent tracks from both the tracker and the muon systems that join together, or that a series of hits in the tracker matches up with at least one hit in the muon system~\cite{CMS-PAPER-MUO-10-004}. 
%
A tight muon must have \pt greater than 20~\GeV and be central --- $|\eta|<2.4$. 
It must also be considered a Global muon, with additional requirements on the global muon track. 
There must be at least one hit from the muon chambers included in the global track, and the $\chi^{2}$ of the global track must be less than 10. These requirements suppress mistaken muon identification as a result of hadronic punch-through from the \ac{HCAL} and the magnet, and suppress muons originating from in-flight decays.
There must also be hits in at least two of the muon stations, which acts to reduce the number of accidental track-to-segment matches.
In order to suppress the number of cosmic muons (and further suppress muons from in-flight decays), the transverse impact parameter of the track ($d_{xy}$) as reconstructed in the tracker must be less than 2~mm from the primary vertex. 
Requiring the longitudinal impact parameter ($d_{z}$) to be less than 5~mm has a similar effect, as well as reducing the number of muons which originate from \ac{PU}.
Additional demands on the number of hits in the pixel system ($>0$) and the number of tracker layers with hits ($>5$) further suppress in-flight muon decays, and guarantee a good measurement of the muon \pt.

The electron identification used in the analysis is loose. To be classified as an electron, a track in the tracker must match up to a supercluster in the \ac{ECAL}. 
The \pt must be greater than 10~\GeV, 
and the electron reconstruction avoids the gap between the \ac{ECAL} barrel and endcap where there is no instrumentation (and thus reconstruction is far from optimal): 
$1.44< |\eta| < 1.56 $. 
In addition, various simple parameters regarding the supercluster shower shape, matching between the \ac{ECAL} cluster and track, 
the ratio of energy deposited in the \ac{ECAL} and \ac{HCAL}, and impact parameters distinguish between primary electrons and those originating from bremsstrahlung and photon pair conversion. More information can be found in Ref.~\cite{CMS:elecReco}.

To ensure that electrons and muons are isolated --- not close to a jet or other object --- they must satisfy requirements on the isolation parameter $R$, defined as
\begin{equation}
Iso = \frac{\sum{\ET_{\text{charged hadrons}}}+ \sum{\ET_{\text{neutral hadrons}}}+ \sum{\ET_{\text{photons}}} }{\pt},
\end{equation} 
where the hadrons and photons are considered in a cone with radius $\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta \phi ^{2} + \Delta \eta ^{2}}=0.4$ around the lepton direction.
Tight muons must have $Iso<0.2$, and loose electrons must have $Iso<0.15$.
Isolations are corrected for the effect of \ac{PU} using $\Delta\beta$ corrections~\cite{deltabeta_htautau7tev}.


The $\tau$ lepton decays hadronically 65\% of the time, with the dominant decay modes consisting of one or three charged $\pi^{\pm}$ mesons, and up to two neutral $\pi^{0}$ mesons.
The \ac{HPS} algorithm first reconstructs the $\pi^{0}$ component of the \tauh decay using a \ac{PF} anti-k$_{\rm t}$ seed jet with distance parameter 0.5, and then combines with charged hadrons to build a \tauh. 
`Strips' are constructed from \ac{PF} photons and electrons, starting with the most energetic electromagnetic particle within the seed jet, and combining all surrounding electromagnetic particles.
Strips with $\pt > 1$~\GeV are then combined with charged hadrons to provide a \tauh candidate. 
Here, the candidate must have $\pt > 20$~\GeV and $|\eta| < 2.3$ and the loose requirements of the algorithm are used which correspond to approximately 1\% of jets to be misidentified as a $\tauh$.
Again, $\Delta\beta$ corrections account for \ac{PU}. 
More information can be found in Ref.~\cite{bib:HPStaus}.

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:ANA}

The aim is to select signal candidate events while rejecting as much background as possible.
A final state with one, high \pt leading jet, and large \MET from the LSPs leaving the detector form the basis of the event selection in order to be sensitive to compressed \ac{SUSY} signatures.

\subsection{Event Cleaning}

The first stage of the event selection, after the trigger, is to reject any events that have passed the trigger due to instrumental noise or non-collision backgrounds.

Events are required to have at least one well-reconstructed primary vertex~\cite{bib:ANA_Tk}, where it is reconstructed in a 24~cm window along the beam axis, within a radius of $\rho<2$~cm orthogonal to the plane of the beam. %The number of degrees of freedom must be less than 4.
To reject events that have ``scraping'' tracks due to beam-gas interactions close to the interaction point, in events where there are 10 or more tracks at least 25\% must be good quality; that is, satisfy various requirements on the number of hits, the \pt of the track, the $\chi^{2}$ of the combination of hits which build the track etc.
To remove events with spurious \MET reconstruction, different methods of calculating the \MET are compared. The value of \MET, reconstructed using the \ac{PF} algorithm, must be comparable with the \MET calculated using calorimetric information only: events with (PF \MET - calo \MET)$ > 2 \times$ calo \MET are discarded.



%event cleaning
% The reported TOC/TEC problem \cite{bib:TOCTEC} has been shown to have a negligable effect here.
% There is a large discrepancy between PFMET and caloMET in affected events, 
% see Appendix~\ref{toctec} for comparison between PFMET and caloMET which shows no significant discrepancies between the two. 
% The requirement on PFMET and caloMET removes the majority of these events, and those remaining have been visually inspected.


Beam-halo and other beam-related backgrounds~\cite{bib:ANA_BeamHalo}, which arise when the beams interact with the beam pipes, 
can deposit energy in both the \ac{ECAL} and \ac{HCAL} leaving no associated tracks.
Cosmic muons also can give rise to fake \MET, 
or leave similarly spurious deposits - leading to fake jets - as they deposit energy in one or more of the subdetectors while leaving no tracks, or tracks which do not originate from the primary vertex.
Similarly, instrumental noise can lead to large apparent deposits in the \ac{ECAL} or \ac{HCAL}. 
Stringent requirements are therefore placed on the neutral and charged hadronic and electromagnetic content of jets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Leading jet charged electromagnetic fraction $<$ 0.7
\item Leading jet charged hadronic fraction $>$ 0.2
\item Leading jet neutral electromagnetic fraction $<$ 0.7
\item Leading jet neutral hadronic fraction $<$ 0.7
\item Second jet neutral electromagnetic fraction $<$ 0.9
\item Second jet neutral hadronic fraction $<$ 0.7
\end{itemize}
These conditions also reject high \pt photons and electrons which are misidentified as jets due to 
energy deposits in the \ac{HCAL}; the energies assigned to neutral hadrons in the 
ECAL and HCAL must sum to less than 70\% of the total jet energy.
In addition, jets are also required to pass a loose identification criterion which rejects fake jets due to calorimeter noise. 

The distributions for the neutral and charged energy fractions of the first and second jet in events (where jets are \pt ordered) before and after these set of noise cleaning cuts are applied are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:ANA_energy_fraction_cleanup} and~\ref{fig:ANA_energy_fraction_cleanup_cut}. 
They are very effective at removing noisy events, with good data/MC agreement after the cuts have been applied.

%The application of all event cleaning criteria results in the loss of 4.2\% of the events for a representative ADD signal, 1.8\% of events for a representative dark matter model and 6.7\% for a representative Unparticle signal.

\subsection{Signal region event selection}

Once events passing the trigger have been filtered to remove noise and fakes, 
events are selected to optimize signal acceptance while rejecting as much background as possible.

To satisfy trigger requirements, and ensure most events comfortably pass the \ac{HLT} trigger selection, 
events are required to have $\METmu > 200$~\GeV and the most energetic jet ($\jet_1$) in the event is required 
to have $\pt(\jet_1)>110~\GeV$ and $|\eta(\jet{}_1)|<2.4$.
%§c
Signal acceptance is increased by allowing events where there is a second jet $(\jet_2)$ originating from \ac{ISR} (or \ac{FSR}); 
however the signal also has soft final-state jets originating from the sparticle decay products.
%
To ensure that these soft final-state jets coming from charm or bottom quarks remain invisible within the event selection,
%
and a monojet signature is maintained,
the \pt threshold at which the second and third jets are counted must be high enough that
the soft-hadronic (signal) decay products 
fall below it for a good range of signal phase space 
%(and therefore remain invisible in the event selection), 
while keeping the QCD multijet background at a manageable level.
%
Figure~\ref{stopj2pT} shows the \pt distribution of charm quarks, taken from simulation, 
for a few representative mass hypotheses in the process $\ttwocc$.
%
Placing the jet counting threshold at $\pt >60$~\GeV, and requiring $|\eta| < 4.5$,
is a good compromise between signal efficiency and background rejection.
%
Events are therefore vetoed if they contain more than 2 jets,
where $\pt(\jet_{1})>110$~\GeV and $|\eta|<2.4$; $\pt(\jet_{2})>60$~\GeV and $|\eta|<4.5$; 
and the third jet is counted (and the event rejected) if it has $\pt(\jet_{3})>60$~\GeV and $|\eta|<4.5$.
A monojet-like topology in signal events is therefore maintained, 
allowing the search to be sensitive to both highly compressed spectra
and extending the scope to larger mass differences.  

\begin{figure*}%[tb]
  \begin{center}

         \label{stopj2pT}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

To reduce the \ac{QCD} dijet background, if two jets are present in the event, they must not be back-to-back: 
$\Delta \phi (\jet_1,\jet_2) < 2.5$. 
The multijet background is largely rejected by the \njets$\ge2$ requirement.


In order to reduce the background from \Z{} and \W-boson decays, events
with leptons are rejected.
Events containing one or more loose electrons with $\pt > 10$~\GeV (where loose requirements are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:objectReco}) are rejected. 
Similarly, events containing any loose muons with $\pt > 10$ \GeV are also rejected. 
In addition, events containing hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons are vetoed, where $\tauh$ are reconstructed using the \ac{HPS} algorithm as described in Section~\ref{sec:objectReco}.
The vetoes here use loose requirements of object reconstruction, to reject as many leptons --- and as much of the electroweak background --- as possible.

A trigger efficiency of unity is ensured by requiring $\METmu>250~\GeV$. Search regions are then defined by thresholds of the leading jet $\pt$; $\pt(\jet_{1}) >$ 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 and 550~\GeV.
These are inclusive search regions, determined by the hardness of the \ac{ISR} jet in each event.
Typically, for a larger \sTop mass, there is a larger boost to the \sTop\santiTop{} system --- see Figure~\ref{stopstoppT}. 
By having many, inclusive, search regions, sensitivity to a range of \sTop (and \sBot) masses is gained.  
The baseline search region is defined by the above selection and a leading jet threshold of 250~\GeV.

%Optimisation studies have been performed for each of our signal samples to find the value of the \MET\ cut that gives the best expected limit. The study is documented in Appendix~\ref{app:opt_limit}. For both the ADD and dark matter signal points, the optimal \MET\ cut is found to be 350 \GeV. For Unparticles, the optimal \MET cut is found to be 300 \GeV or 350 \GeV, depending on the values of $d_U$. However the difference in expected limit is small and therefore a \MET\ cut of 350 \GeV is used for calculating limits, consistent with what is used for the ADD and dark matter signals.

\section{Background estimation and systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:BKG}

As evident in Table~\ref{tab:SEL_TabDataMC200}, the dominant backgrounds in the search regions after the monojet event selection are electroweak backgrounds.
The largest contribution is due to invisible \Z{} boson decays, \znunubr\,+\,jets, which is irreducible as the neutrinos mimic the \ac{LSP}s and there is genuine \MET in the final state. 
The secondary background is due to leptonic \W{} boson decay, \wlnubr\,+\,jets, where the lepton (electrons and muons, including those from leptonically decaying taus) is not reconstructed, outside of the kinematic acceptance of the lepton vetoes or not isolated.
Both of these backgrounds are estimated from data by selecting a control sample of $\mu$+jet events, where \zmumubr\,+\,jets events are used to predict the invisible Z background and \wmunubr\,+\,jets events are used to predict the \wlnubr\,+\,jets background.
Small contributions from \ac{QCD} multijet and \ttbar{} events are estimated using simulation and corrected for differences in MC and data using dedicated control samples.
Diboson (\W\W{}, \W\Z{} and \Z\Z{}) processes are taken from simulation. Events due to $\rm{V}\gamma$ processes are estimated as a part of the electroweak data driven backgrounds.
Very small contributions from single top quark and Drell--Yan processes are taken directly from simulation.


The control sample of $\mu$\,+\,jets events used to estimate the electroweak background is 
obtained by applying the full monojet selection with the exception of the muon veto.
The definition of \METmu to exclude muons and therefore allow muons to mimic neutrinos or missing leptons at both the trigger level and in reconstructed events allows the use of the same trigger for both the search and control regions. 
As well as being rather simple, this has the advantage of reducing the systematic uncertainties associated with combining two data samples.
%Well-reconstructed 
%and isolated muons with $\pt(\mu)>20\GeV$  are selected following 
%the criteria described in Section~\ref{sec:ANA}.

\subsection{Data-driven \znunubr\,+\,jets background estimation}
\label{sec:znunu}

The large and irreducible \znunubr\,+\,jets background is estimated using a muon control sample of \zmumubr\,+\,jets events.
By exploiting the similar kinematics of \znunu and \zmumu processes, and their known branching ratios, we extrapolate from the number of dimuon events in muon control regions to the number of \znunubr\,+\,jets events in the signal regions.

From the muon control sample defined using the monojet event selection with the exception of the muon veto, we select events to form a dimuon control sample enriched in \zmumubr\,+\,jets events.
Two muons of opposite sign are required, where at least one must satisfy the tight muon requirements of Section~\ref{sec:objectReco:lep} and the other satisfies the loose muon requirements.
The invariant mass of the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pair must be within the \Z{} mass window, which we take to be within $60<m_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}<120~\GeV$. 
These criteria of one tight and one loose muon represent a good compromise between having a well-reconstructed \Z{} boson while maintaining reasonable statistics.
Event yields in the dimuon control sample are shown in Table~\ref{tab:Zmuontable}.
The control region requirements are very effective at selecting \zellell events, however there are a small number of non-Z events that contribute to the event yield in data - namely from \ttbar, diboson and single top quark processes.

The \zmumu and \znunu events share similar kinematic characteristics and by interpreting the pair of muons as missing energy, the topology of the process in which the $Z$ boson decays to neutrinos can be reproduced.  
A comparison between data and MC for the dimuon invariant mass and momentum after all the selection cuts and requiring $\pt(\jet_1)>250~\GeV$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BKGR_Z_mass}.
The number of \znunu events can then be predicted using:

\begin{equation}
N(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu) = \frac{N^{\rm obs}_{\mu\mu} - N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu\mu}}{A*\epsilon}\cdot R ,
\label{eq:znunudatadriven}
\end{equation}
where $N^{\rm obs}_{\mu\mu}$ is the number of observed dimuon events, $N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu\mu}$ is the number of non-\zmumubr{} events contributing to the dimuon sample, $A$ is the acceptance of the control sample criteria and $\epsilon$ is the selection efficiency of a reconstructed event provided it was produced within the acceptance of the criteria, and $R$ is the ratio of branching fractions for the $Z$ decay to neutrinos and a pair of muons. These factors are determined as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item $ N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu\mu}$ : The dimuon sample comprises predominantly of \zmumu events with contamination from other, non-\zmumubr\, processes at the level of 5\%. These backgrounds are taken from simulation and a 50\% uncertainty is assigned their yields. 

\item $A$ : The acceptance $A$ is defined as the fraction of all generated events, prior to hadronization and reconstruction 
(i.e. at quark and lepton level as described by the event generator), that satisfy the requirements of the control sample. 
One muon must satisfy $\pt > 20$ \GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$, and the other, of opposite sign, satisfy $\pt > 10$ \GeV. The invariant mass of the muons must lie within 60 \GeV and 120 \GeV. This is obtained from Z\,+\,jets simulation.

\item $\epsilon$ : The event selection efficiency $\epsilon$ is defined as the efficiency of reconstructing two muons passing all the identification and isolation criteria that have a reconstructed invariant mass between 60 and 120 $\GeV$, given that they are within the detector acceptance $A$. 
The efficiency is taken from simulation, once it has passed through the hadronization and reconstruction stages (unlike for $A$).
It is corrected by a scale factor to account for the difference in selection efficiency between data and MC.

\item $R$ : The ratio of the branching fraction $R = (\frac{BF(\znunubr)}{BF(\zellellbr)})$ is obtained from Ref.~\cite{PDG} and 
   is $5.942\pm 0.019$ when $l=\mu$. 
\end{itemize}
 
The prediction of the \znunubr{}\,+\,jets background in the search regions relies on counting the number of 
\zmumubr\,+\,jets events at each $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ threshold, which is in turn
correlated to the \METmu requirement.
In the definition of \METmu, we interpret muons as missing energy: 
muon \ptv is added into the \METv to calculate \METvmu.
As the \METvmu in an event is largely balanced by $\ptv(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$, 
the values of \METmu and $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ thus rely on successfully 
identifying both muons arising from a \zmumu decay. 

If either (or both) of the muons in a \zmumu decay is not properly identified, 
then the value of \METmu may be wrong.
For example, if one of the muons does not pass identification requirements but the track is reconstructed, 
then the energy of that muon will be included within the \METv calculation (reconstructed using the \ac{PF} algorithm).
However, the muon will not be identified using tight or loose requirements, and its \ptv will not be included in the \METvmu calculation.
The value of \METvmu will then be incorrect, 
and the event is likely to fail the selection requirements on \METmu or $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$.
%
It will not contribute to the total number of \zmumubr\,+\,jets events and therefore reduce the total \znunubr\,+\,jets background estimation.
However, if it had of been a \znunubr\,+\,jets event, 
both neutrinos would lead to \MET --- in neglecting such events we underestimate the \znunubr\,+\,jets background.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:metratio} shows the distribution of the ratio of \METmu to the \pt of the \Z{} boson $\pt(\Z)$, 
taken from \zmumubr\,+\,jets and \znunubr\,+\,jets simulation. 
The larger tail at low values of $\METmu/\pt(\Z)$ in \zmumubr\,+\,jets events is attributed to events where one or both muons is not properly identified as described above.
In order to correct for this effect we count the number of events in simulation where the ratio $\METmu/\pt(\Z)< 0.7$, at each $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ threshold in the dimuon control sample, with the additional criteria that the $\pt(\Z{})>250$~\GeV to ensure $\METmu$, when measured correctly, $>250~\GeV$. 
The value of 0.7 is chosen because the resolution of the \Z{} boson mass peak is $\sim 0.3$, and we wish to count events in the tail of the spectrum.
This gives an estimation of the number of events where we have not properly measured or identified one or two of the muons. 
The ratio in each search region is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Zinv_genZMETmu_SF}. 
This correction factor is combined with the difference in data and simulation for muon selection efficiency and applied in each search region.

%In addition, a 4.7$\%$ correction is applied to the predicted \znunu background to account for an inefficiency in \zmumu\ events where the muon track is reconstructed but the muon is not identified. These events were studied by plotting the ratio of \MET and the generated $Z$ boson \pt, they are present in the low tail of the distribution, below around 0.7, in \zmumu\ events but absent in the same distribution for \znunu events. 
%We therefore estimate the selection efficiency using Z\,+\,jets MC and assign a systematic of 2$\%$ to cover the variation of the data-MC scale factor from 1.0, measured in~\cite{bib:AN-11-240}.

A correction factor is applied to R in order to account for contamination from $\gamma^{*}$ events in the data that fall within the selection criteria of the control sample, as well as efficiency of the mass window requirement. 
Using \zmumubr\,+\,jets and \znunubr\,+\,jets simulated events, 
the $\gamma^{*}$ contamination $R^{\gamma^{*}}$ can be estimated using
   \begin{equation}
   R^{\gamma^{*}} = \frac{1-\alpha}{1-\beta} ,
   \end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the difference in the normalized yield of \zmumubr\,+\,jets and \znunubr\,+\,jets events in the Z mass window, $60< m_{\Z{}} < 120~\GeV$, and
   $\beta$ is the fraction of events lying outside the Z mass window in \znunubr\,+\,jets simulation.
Normalized across all $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ bins, we find a correction factor of 1.017.


Table~\ref{tab:Zinv_factors} shows the observed dimuon event yields, non-\zmumubr event yields, the acceptance $A$ and efficiency $\epsilon$. The ratio of branching fractions $R$ is corrected by $R^{\gamma^{*}}$, and given (it is the same for each threshold). 
The uncertainties on these factors are discussed below. 

%A summary of the fractional contributions of the uncertainties to the total error on the \znunu background is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Z_jets_sys}. 
%The dominant contribution to the uncertainty is the statistical uncertainty from the size of the \zmumu sample. 

%For the baseline selection, this is found to be 14131.5$\pm$xxxxx. This can be compared to the prediction from the invisible Z MC, 14728.9$\pm$xxxx.

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on data-driven \znunubr\,+\,jets background estimation}

The dominant source of uncertainty on the \znunubr\,+\,jets background estimation arises from statistical uncertainties on $N^{\rm obs}_{\mu\mu}$.
It increases as the $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ threshold is increased, and contributes 2.1--17\%.

The uncertainty on $N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu\mu}$, arising from non-\zmumubr processes, is taken as 
50\% of the respective yields, where the total uncertainty on $N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu\mu}$ is the quadratic sum of the individual contributions. 
As the total contribution from non-\zmumubr processes in the control region is small, of order 5\%, this uncertainty has a relatively minor contribution to the total uncertainty, varying from 1.6--3.5\%.

The total uncertainty on $A$ arises from both statistical and systematic sources. 
The statistical uncertainty is due the number of simulated events used to derive the ratio. 
A 2\% systematic uncertainty is added to this, to incorporate the uncertainty on the \ac{PDFs} used to describe the colliding protons.
Similarly, the total uncertainty on $\epsilon$ is due to the statistics of the simulation and incorporates a 2\% systematic uncertainty on the hadronization process. 
These systematics dominate over the statistical uncertainties, where the total uncertainty on $A$ varies from 2.0--2.9\%, and on $\epsilon$ from 2.1--5.5\%. 
There are fewer events with muons reconstructed within the kinematic acceptance of the control sample than are generated within the kinematic acceptance, hence the statistical uncertainty - and therefore total uncertainty - on $\epsilon$ is larger than the uncertainty on $A$.

A 2\% systematic uncertainty is assigned to $R$, in order to incorporate the uncertainties on the 
ratio of branching fractions (which are much smaller than 2\%), 
and on the correction factor $R^{\gamma^{*}}$ (itself less than 2\%), which incorporates 
the uncertainty due to the restriction of the Z mass window on branching fractions,
and on the contribution of $\gamma^{*}$ events in the control sample.

The uncertainties from the various sources are added in quadrature, and are listed in Table~\ref{tab:Z_jets_sys}. 
The total uncertainty varies between 5.3 and 19\%.

\subsection{Data-driven \wlnubr\,+\,jets background estimation}
\label{sec:wjets}

The second largest contribution to the total SM background arises from \wlnubr\,+\,jets events. 
The lepton (\e and \mu, including those from leptonically decaying $\tau$ leptons) fails the respective lepton veto
and hence is ``lost'', i.e. it is not isolated, not identified, or outside of the acceptance of 
the analysis. 
Similarly, \tauh leptons which are not identified contribute to this lost-lepton background.
The contributions in the search regions from lost-lepton events are evaluated in a similar way to the \znunubr\,+\,jets background, using a muon control sample enriched in \wmunubr\,+\,jets events.

From the muon control sample defined using the same triggers as the search regions with the exception of the muon veto, a sample enriched in \wmunubr\,+\,jets events is obtained by requiring one muon satisfying the tight muon criteria with a reconstructed W transverse mass $m_{T} = \sqrt{2 \pt^{mu} \met (1 - \cos{\Delta \phi}) }$ that lies between 50 and 100~GeV, where $\Delta\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the \metvmu and $\ptv^{\mu}$ vectors.
Event yields in the \wmunubr\,+\,jets-enriched single muon control sample are listed in Table~\ref{tab:Wmuontable} with the predicted SM processes from simulation. 
A comparison between data and MC for the transverse mass and momentum of the W after the full selection and for $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1) > 250~\GeV$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BKGR_W_mass}.

The total number of \wmunubr{}+jets events is estimated in an analogous way to the \znunubr{} background,
correcting the observed number of single muon events in the control sample $N^{\rm obs}_{\mu}$ by events due to non-\wpj processes $N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu}$.  
The resulting \wmunu events are then corrected for the kinematic acceptance $A'$ of the control sample, and the efficiency $\epsilon'$ of reconstructing events within the acceptance in the detector to obtain the total number of generated events ($N^{\rm tot}_{\mu}$):
\begin{equation}
N^{\rm tot}_{\mu} = \frac{N^{\rm obs}_{\mu} - N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu}}{A'\epsilon'}.\label{eqn:Ntot}
\end{equation}

The resulting number of \wmunu events produced in the detector is subsequently weighted by a muon veto inefficiency factor in order to obtain the predicted number of \wmunubr\,+\,jets events that would not be rejected by the lepton veto and thus remain in the search regions.
%
The total number of $W \rightarrow \mu\nu +$jets events that are out of the acceptance and not identified or isolated can be written as:
\begin{equation}
N^{\rm lost}_{\mu} = N^{\rm tot}_{\mu}(1 - A_{\mu}\epsilon_{\mu}).
\end{equation}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%N_{!A}^{\mu} &=& N_{tot}^{\mu}*(1 - A_{\mu})\\
%N_{!\epsilon}^{\mu} &=& N_{tot}^{\mu}*A_{\mu}*(1 - \epsilon_{\mu})\\
%\end{eqnarray}
where $A_{\mu}$ is the acceptance of the loose muon selection requirements (used in the muon veto) before any reconstruction has taken place, 
and $\epsilon_{\mu}$ is the efficiency of the reconstruction for muons satisfying selection requirements when produced (i.e. for muons within the acceptance $A_{\mu}$).
$A_{\mu}$ and $\epsilon_{\mu}$ are estimated using simulation and corrected for differences between data and MC.

To estimate the lost electron background, we begin by finding the total number of \wenu events produced $N^{\rm tot}_{\e}$.
The ratio of the number of \wmunubr\,+\,jets to \wenubr\,+\,jets events produced, before any reconstruction has taken place, is taken from simulation and labelled $f_{\e}$.  
Then, $N^{\rm tot}_{\e} = N^{\rm tot}_{\mu}  f_{\e}$. 
The number of lost \wenu events can subsequently be found by correcting for the electron veto ineffiency factor:
\begin{eqnarray}
N^{\rm lost}_{\e} &=& N^{\rm tot}_{\e}(1 - A_{\e}\epsilon_{\e}).
\end{eqnarray}
Both the $A_{\e}$ and $\epsilon_{\e}$ factors are obtained using simulation, where $A_{\e}$ is the acceptance of the loose electron selection requirements (used in the electron veto) before any reconstruction has taken place, 
and $\epsilon_{\e}$ is the efficiency of reconstruction for electrons satisfying selection requirements when produced (i.e. for electrons within the acceptance $A_{\e}$).
A data/MC scale factor of 1.0 is assumed. % with an assigned systematic that covers the variation in efficiency between data and MC.
%Table~\ref{tab:wjetslost} summarises the estimated lost muon and electron background.
%A detailed table showing the various factors that are used to estimate this background is shown in Table~\ref{tab:wjets-summary}.

%The same procedure as that outlined in the above equations is then followed to obtain the number of events where the electron is not reconstructed/isolated or out of the acceptance. The electron acceptance is obtained using generator level MC and the selection efficiency is also obtained from MC with an assigned systematic that covers the variation in efficiency between data and MC.
%~\cite{bib:AN-11-240}.
The component of the \wpj background from \tauh events is estimated in the same way. 
The ratio of the number of \wmunubr\,+\,jets to \wtauhnubr\,+\,jets events ($f_{\tau}$) produced prior to reconstruction is taken from simulation and used to obtain $N^{\rm tot}_{\tau}$. This is subsequently weighted by the inefficiency of the tau selection used in the $\tauh$ veto to obtain the lost-lepton background due to \tauh events:
\begin{eqnarray}
N^{\rm tot}_{\tauh}  &=& N^{\rm tot}_{\mu}f_{\tauh},\\
N^{\rm lost}_{\tauh} &=& N^{\rm tot}_{\tauh}(1 - A_{\tauh}\epsilon_{\tauh}).
\end{eqnarray}
The \tauh identification acceptance and efficiency is estimated from simulation with a data/MC scale factor of 1.0 and assigned an uncertainty of 6$\%$ as recommended by the \ac{CMS} Tau Physics Object Group. 
The electron and muon discriminants in the tau identification can also result in the tau veto rejecting electron and muon events. 
The probability of an electron or muon to fake a tau is estimated from \wpj{} simulation and found to be negligible, below 0.1\%.
% No correction is made to these fake rates to account for data/MC differences as recommended by the Tau POG.  The Tau POG recommends an uncertainty of 5$\%$ on the electron fake rate for electrons in the Barrel and 10$\%$ for those in the Endcap and a 30$\%$ uncertainty on the muon fake rate. Since the fake rates are very small for our analysis, we assign 10$\%$ to electrons in both the Barrel and Endcap and the recommended 30$\%$ for muons. 
% Table~\ref{tab:wjetstau-summary} shows the tau acceptance and efficiency that are used to obtain the remaining tau hadronic background. More details on the tau acceptance, efficiency and fake rates at different stages of the monojet selection are given in Table~\ref{tab:wjets-hadronictau}. 

All of the above components can be summarised in a `master' equation for estimating the lost-lepton background:
\begin{equation}
N^{\rm lost}_{lep} = \frac{N^{\rm obs}_{\mu} - N^{\rm bgd}_{\mu}}{A'\epsilon'}\Big[(1 - A_{\mu}\epsilon_{\mu}) + f_{\e}(1 - A_{\e}\epsilon_{\e}) + f_{\tauh}(1 - A_{\tauh}\epsilon_{\tauh})\Big]
\label{eq:lostleptotal}
\end{equation}
The factors in Eq.~\ref{eq:lostleptotal} used to estimate the lost muon, electron and hadronic tau backgrounds are listed in Table~\ref{tab:wjetslost}.

\subsubsection{Uncertainties on the data-driven lost-lepton background}

The fractional contributions to the total uncertainty on the lost-lepton background are shown in Table~\ref{tab:wjetssys}.
The statistical uncertainty on the number of events in the single muon control sample dominates the total uncertainty on the lost-lepton background (1.0--8.6\%) as the jet threshold increases and the number of \wmunubr\,+\,jets events decreases. 

The uncertainty on the non-\wpj{} processes in the single muon control sample contributes 3.3--4.4\% to the total uncertainty. 
It is taken to be 50\% of each individual contribution added quadratically, in the same way as for the \znunubr\,+\,jets background estimation --- here there is a larger yield from background processes, hence this uncertainty is larger than the similar numbers in Table~\ref{tab:Z_jets_sys}.

Systematic uncertainties due to hadronization, 2\%, (PDF, 2\%) uncertainties are absorbed into the uncertainties on $A'$, $A_{\e}$ and $A_{\tauh}$ ($\epsilon'$, $\epsilon_{\e}$ and $\epsilon_{\tauh}$).
No factor is added into $A_{\mu}$ and $\epsilon_{\mu}$ to avoid double-counting - these 
uncertainties, related to the generation and reconstruction of simulated muon events, have already been considered in the calculation of $N^{\rm tot}_{\mu}$. 
They are reconsidered in the case of the lost electron and \tauh lepton events in order to account for any differences in their generation as compared to muon events.
The uncertainties on acceptance and efficiency in each calculation are considered fully correlated, 
because efficiency is dependent on acceptance and we wish to be conservative.
The uncertainties on data/MC scale factors and on the number of simulated events in the control samples are also considered.
The combined uncertainties on acceptances and efficiencies in the lost-lepton background estimation dominate the total uncertainty, contributing 4.5--7.1\%.


A summary of the lost-lepton background in the search regions is shown in Table~\ref{tab:wjetstotal}.  


%The remaining component of the W\,+\,jets background which is not accounted for by this method is that from hadronically decaying tau. This is taken from W\,+\,jets MC and corrected by the data/MC scale factor obtained from \wmunu\ events.
%Since the control sample for this background estimation is obtained by relaxing the track isolation veto, we estimate the TIV efficiency from MC for all the \MET\ regions and apply this efficiency to obtain the final W\,+\,jets prediction. 


% The uncertainty on the W\,+\,jets estimation includes; the statistical uncertainty on the number of single-muon events in the data, a 50$\%$ uncertainty on the background events obtained from MC, an uncertainty on acceptance from PDFs (2\%) and MC statistics and an uncertainty on the selection efficiency $\epsilon$ from the variation in the data/MC scale factor and MC statistics.

\subsection{QCD Background Estimation}
\label{section:QCD}

The QCD multijet contribution in the search regions is expected to be small, $\approx 2\%$.
It is evaluated using simulation, with data/MC correction factors derived from data control regions enriched in multijet events.

The QCD control region is defined using the search region event selection, 
apart from those cuts that remove the majority of the QCD: $\Delta \phi(\jet_1, \jet_2)<2.5$ and $\njets < 3$.
The \pt requirement used to count jets is varied between 20 and 80~\GeV, as this parameter is sensitive to the number of multijet events satisfying the requirements of the search regions. 
We further require $\Delta \phi (\METmu, \jet_{2}) < 0.3$, as this sideband is highly populated with multijet events in which the \MET has been mismeasured. 
Such events have back-to-back jets where the mismeasured \METvmu vector is aligned with the second jet and is in the opposite hemisphere to the leading jet. 
Figure~\ref{dphi_METj2} shows a comparison of the data and MC for this control region, where the excess of QCD multijet events is evident at low  $\Delta \phi (\METmu,\jet_{2})$.


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/sus13009/dPhi_MetLep_Jet2.pdf}
\caption{The QCD rich region dominated by back to back jets, $\Delta \phi(\METmu, \jet_2)<0.3$, shown for a jet counting cut of 60~\GeV for $\pt(\jet_1) > 250~\GeV$.}
\label{dphi_METj2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The event yields for data and MC in this region are shown in Table~\ref{QCDtable} for each jet counting \pt threshold and for $\pt(\jet_{1})>250~\GeV$. 
A scale factor $R^{\rm QCD}$ on the QCD background is derived using the Equation~\ref{qcdSF}:
\begin{equation}
\label{qcdSF}
R^{\rm QCD} = \frac{ N^{\rm obs}_{\rm QCD} - N^{\rm bgd}_{\rm QCD} }{ N^{\rm pred}_{\rm QCD} },
\end{equation}
where $N^{\rm obs}_{\rm QCD}$ is the observed number if events in the QCD control region and $N^{\rm bgd}_{\rm QCD}$ is the sum of the non-QCD events, taken from simulation and corrected with data/MC scale factors according to the data-driven estimations given in Section~\ref{sec:znunu} and \ref{sec:wjets} where applicable.


\begin{table}[htdp]
\caption{Event yields from MC and data for $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)>250$~\GeV and for different values of the $\pt$ threshold used for jet counting in the QCD rich region $\Delta \phi (\MET, j_{2}) < 0.3 $. Relative uncertainty on a scale factor derived from the data is also shown.

The QCD scale factor $R^{\rm QCD}$ in each search region is found by taking the mean scale factor from all the jet counting thresholds.
The scale factors applied to the QCD multijet event yield, from simulation, in search region are shown in Table~\ref{tab:QCDFinaltable}.
A correction factor of 1.53 at $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1) > 250 \GeV$ is required, decreasing to 1.35 at $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1) > 550 \GeV$. 
This is greater than the factor from the dijet resonance analysis of 1.22~\cite{CMS:exoDijetRes}, 
but the search regions here are in a different region of phase space so it is not unexpected.

\begin{table}[htdp]
\caption{QCD scale factor derived from QCD rich control region for each inclusive $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ bin with relative error

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc} \hline
$\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ (\GeV) & QCD$_{s.f.}$ & Relative Error \\ \hline
250 &  1.534 &  0.336\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:QCDFinaltable}
\end{table}%


The total relative uncertainties on $R^{\rm QCD}$ are shown in Table~\ref{tab:QCDFinaltable}.
They are due to the statistical uncertainty on the number of events in data (which is negligible)
and the systematic uncertainty on the number of non-QCD events in the control regions. An uncertainty of 50\% is assigned to each non-QCD background, and contributions are added quadratically.
In the final QCD estimation, the uncertainties on $R^{\rm QCD}$ are combined with a 50\% uncertainty on the raw QCD multijet yield in simulation.
The final QCD background estimation in the search regions is shown in Table~\ref{tab:QCDpred}.

To provide a further cross check that the QCD prediction is sensible, we check the agreement for  $\Delta \phi (\MET, j_{3})$. 
Figure~\ref{dphi_METj3} shows the distribution for a jet counting threshold of 60~\GeV and $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)>250$\GeV; data agrees with MC within errors assigned.

 \end{center}
 \end{figure}


\subsection{\ttbar background estimation}
\label{sec:ttbar}
The contribution of \ttbar events in the search regions is predicted to be small, $\approx2\%$.
It is estimated using simulation normalized using the \ac{NNLO} cross section~\cite{ttbarxs}, 
and cross checked using a data control sample enriched in \ttbar events. 
The data control sample is derived from the same trigger as the search regions, satisfying the selection criteria of $\METmu>250~\GeV$ and $\pt(\jet_1)>110~\GeV$, along with the event cleaning criteria. 
In addition, $\Delta \phi(\jet_1, \jet_2)<2.5$, and, to select leptonic decays of \ttbar events, 
a well-identified electron is required, and a loose muon of opposite sign. 
The invariant mass of the $\e\mu$ pair must lie above 60~\GeV, removing much of the contribution of \zellellbr\,+\,jets events to the control sample. 

The distributions of the invariant mass and \pt of the $\e\mu$ pair are shown in Figure~\ref{ttbar}.
The event yields from data and simulation are shown in 
Table~\ref{ttbartable}, before and after the invariant mass cut on the $\e\mu$ pair.  
Data and simulation are seen to agree well with one another.
The scale factor $R^{\ttbar}$ is extracted using an analogous method as for $R^{\rm QCD}$, and has a value of 0.97$\pm$0.3, where the uncertainty is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the non-\ttbar processes in the control sample, 
which are taken as 50\% of each.
We therefore find that the \ac{NNLO} cross section used to normalize the \ttbar simulation describes the data well, and apply a data/MC scaling factor of 1.0.

Although probably over-conservative, the uncertainty on the \ttbar background is taken to be 50\% to be consistent with the other background estimations taken from simulation. 
% it covers uncertainties in the \ac{PDF}s, hadronization modelling,

\subsection{Diboson background estimation}
%The remaining backgrounds to the monojet sample from \ttbar, QCD, single top and Z\,+\,jets events are found to be at the 5\% level. These are taken from MC and assigned a 50\% systematic uncertainty.
The diboson (WW, WZ and ZZ) backgrounds are estimated using simulation, where the NLO cross sections~\cite{MCFM:diboson} are used to normalise event yield to the integrated luminosity of the search regions. 
The diboson backgrounds where one of the bosons is a photon V$\gamma$: $\W\gamma$, $\znunubr \gamma$ and $\zellellbr \gamma$, are treated inclusively: they are absorbed into the data driven estimates of \W\,+\,jets and \znunubr\,+\,jets, 
and into the MC estimate of \zellellbr\,+\,jets respectively. 

Table~\ref{tab:incl_excl} shows the difference between treating the $V\gamma$ backgrounds inclusively as opposed to exclusively --- taking their yields in the search regions individually from simulation.
The difference in evaluating the \znunubr event yield with and without the inclusion of $\znunubr \gamma$ is calculated, in order to give a data-driven estimation of the $\znunubr \gamma$ background.
This method is compared to the yield from using simulation directly, and agrees within the 50\% uncertainty assigned to all numbers taken from simulation.

\end{table*}

A fluctuation in the ratio of data to MC is observed in the estimation of $\znunubr \gamma$\,+\,jets, for $\pt(j1) > 400$ GeV.
This is due to a statistical upward fluctuation in the $\znunubr \gamma$ simulation around \pt=400~\GeV.
Fitting the data/MC numbers in each $\pt(\,\mathrm{j}_1)$ search region with a straight line, 
such a fluctuation is not observed and the data/MC ratio at $\pt(j1) > 400$ GeV becomes 0.9.



By absorbing $\W\gamma$ and $\znunubr \gamma$ events into the dominant data driven backgrounds 
we not only get a better estimation of these backgrounds as we do not rely on the simulation 
(which does not necessary represent the data accurately in this area of phase space), 
we also reduce the uncertainty on the estimations, 
and in doing so reduce the total errors of the analysis.
This is because the yields (in simulation) of $\W\gamma$ and $\znunubr \gamma$ no longer contribute to $N^{\rm bkg}_{\mu\mu}$ and $N^{\rm bkg}_{\mu}$, so the 50\% uncertainties on the yields are also no longer included in the uncertainty calculation on these numbers. 
Instead, they are accounted for within the $N^{\rm obs}_{\mu\mu}$ and $N^{\rm obs}_{\mu}$ yields with uncertainties calculated as discussed above.


\subsection{Single top quark and Drell--Yan background estimations}

Backgrounds due to single top quark events are predicted to be very small, of order 0.5\%.
Yields are taken directly from simulation and normalized to the approximate \ac{NNLO} cross sections~\cite{ttbarxs}. 
The contribution of Drell--Yan $\zellellbr$\,+\,jets processes in the search regions are predicted to be of a similar size, due to the lepton vetoes - contributing $\approx0.5\%$.
It is combined with the background due to $\zellellbr \gamma$ processes, which is negligible and only included for completeness,
and evaluated using simulation.
An uncertainty of 50\% is assigned to these predictions.


\section{Summary}
A search has been performed for signatures of top and bottom squark production in events with a monojet and large \METmu, using an integrated luminosity of 19.7~\fbinv of pp collisions at 8~\TeV. The contribution of SM \ttbar and multijet events in the search regions is reduced using topological selections. The dominant backgrounds after the complete event selection are from \znunubr\,+\,jets and \wpj events. These are estimated using muon data control samples enriched in \zmumubr and \wmunubr events. Remaining background from \ttbar and multijet processes are estimated using simulation normalized in data control samples, and small contributions of diboson, \zellellbr, and single top quark events are taken from simulation.
