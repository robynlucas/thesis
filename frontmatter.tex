%% Acknowledgements
\begin{acknowledgements}
  % Firstly, I would like to thank my parents and family for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my academic career.
  % Secondly, I thank my supervisors Alex Tapper and Steve Worm for their advice and guidance.
  % I also express huge thanks to the Monojet analysis team; without Phat Srimanobhas my research would not have been possible, and whose patience, help and hard work I am eternally grateful for; Sarah Malik, Shuichi Kunori and Teruki Kamon, whose discussions and guidance have been invaluable.
  % Thanks also to Michele Pioppi and Andy Rose for their patience in helping a fresh faced first year who could not code in the work on upgrade jets.
  % My friends and colleagues who kept me sane in Geneva, through all those jet calibrations; Sam and Sam, Darren, Andrew, Kenzie and Patrick you provided much needed distractions and laughs, as well as more than a little bit of help over the years.
  % Lastly, I cannot express enough thanks to my boyfriend Ed, without whom I could not have survived my PhD. 
  % His unfaltering support, both in Geneva and London, were at times the only thing that kept me going. Sorry I never found the Lucas boson!
  % Finally, I thank the STFC for providing the funding that enabled me to conduct the research presented here, and for the 15 months spent out at CERN.
